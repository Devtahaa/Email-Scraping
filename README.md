# Email-Scraping
This Python script leverages Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping email addresses from a specified google search page. It automates the process of scrolling to the end of the page and interacting with a "Load More" button to dynamically load content. Extracted email addresses are then parsed and saved to an Excel file for easy access
